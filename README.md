# Project Title

California Wildfire Exploration.

## Description

Everything can be found the in the R markdown file named
"CA_Wildfire_Exploration.RMD". 

The "old_files" folder contains the original scripts before they were
condensed into the Rmd file, as well as the output images. 

You can either run the Rmd file chunk by chunk, run it all at once, or view the
HTML output file produced by knitR. 

*NOTE* You will need to download the raw fire database, it's too large
        for me to push.

If you run the chunks, you will need to structure your folders for the files
to be correctly imported into R, or you can change the lines in the code to suit
your system's file structure
